# pands-project: Investigating the Iris Dataset with Python
by Fergus McTiernan

## About this project
In this project, I use python to investigate the Iris dataset, a commonly used dataset for learning data analysis and machine learning.

## The Iris Dataset
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of three different species of Iris flowers: setosa, versicolor and virginica. For each sample, there is data on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width - all measured in centimeteres. [Source](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iris-dataset/)

*Why popular? Why good choice for data analysis?*
The Iris dataset seems to be a good choice for training machine learning algorithms because of its simplicity. There are only four features across three species of flowers, and various sources online claim that these features clearly distinguish one species of flower from another, so if training a machine learning model to predict a category based on the details provided, this dataset seems to be a very straightforward way of doing so.

For the same reason, It could be a good choice for performing data analysis tasks in python, because when producing scatter plots or histograms, being able to see clear distinctions in the features between species will let us know we are doing this correctly. It will allow me to focus on the data analysis tasks, rather than getting overwhelmed or confused by a large and complicated dataset.
